<p>This page contains useful information about my website.</p>

<h2 id="opinions-and-correctness">Opinions and Correctness</h2>

<p>Except where I quote directly, all opinions expressed here are my own.</p>

<p>My writings in an article may not be correct, they are based on my interpretation of what I’m writing about. If you think I’m wrong, please <a href="/contact">contact me</a> and put me straight. If you quote me your quotation may be incorrect.</p>

<p>Progam code that I refer to is not guaranteed to bug free.</p>

<h2 id="cookies-and-local-data">Cookies and Local Data</h2>

<p>The public version of this website does not use cookies, so there is no cookie notice. If I use cookies in the future, they will be for specific functionality (such as a sign-on page) and will be documented on this page.</p>

<p>This website does not track you and I do not pass any personal information supplied by you to third parties without your permission, <em>unless I am required to do so by law</em>. This <em>will never change</em> while I control this website’s content.</p>

<p>I do not use local storage on your browser, if this changes, the changes will be documented on this page.</p>

<h2 id="java-script">Java Script</h2>

<p>This website uses Java Script to improve site functionality. If you have turned Java Script off or you are using a very old browser (such as Internet Explorer), some of the functionality will not be available to you because it requires a modern version of Java Script.</p>

<h2 id="gdpr-and-privacy">GDPR and Privacy</h2>

<p>This is a personal website, so GDPR does not apply. However, I will follow the GDPR rules, I’m just not going to write about them here (I have a life).</p>

<p>I repeat, this website does not track you and I do not pass any personal information supplied by you to third parties without your permission, <em>unless I am required to do so by law</em>. This <em>will never change</em> while I control this site’s content.</p>

<p>The only personal data you give me is the information you supply via my contact page and subsequent emails. This will be stored in a secure manner.</p>
